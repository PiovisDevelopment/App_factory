**The Universal Application Assembler for the Piovis Plugin Framework.**

## What It Does

This skill builds the Frontend (React/Tauri) for your application. Unlike previous versions, it is not limited to "Voice Assistants." It intelligently selects a **UI Archetype** based on your needs and wires it to the Backend using the **Universal Dispatcher**.

- **Archetype Selection**: Automatically chooses between Dashboard (Grid), Canvas (Visual), Form (Data), or Chat (Conversational) layouts.
- **Universal Wiring**: Generates React code that calls `invoke('dispatch', ...)` instead of hardcoded Rust commands. This means you never need to recompile the Rust core when adding features.
- **Component Assembly**: Imports and arranges the "Atomic Components" generated by `ppf_create_plugin`.
- **Design System**: Applies the standardized Draggable/Resizable window system to every app.

## When to Use

Use `ppf_create_application` when you want to:
- **Start a new project**: "Create a Stock Trading Dashboard."
- **Add a UI module**: "Add a settings panel for the Image Gen plugin."
- **Visualize data**: "Create a chart view for my IoT sensors."

## Example Prompts

```text
"Create a Stock Dashboard using the stock_market_data plugin"
"Create an Image Editor canvas for ComfyUI"
"Create a Data Entry form for the inventory_manager plugin"
"Create a Voice Assistant interface for tts_kokoro"
```
